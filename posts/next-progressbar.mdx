A progressbar can always add value to your web app, in terms of user experience, you can inform the
user that something is happening under the hood, in our case we will use it to inform the user that
the route is changing, and this is very helpfull especially for people with slow connection,
because sometime the user will think that your app is not working if he didn't notice that his connection
is slow !

### Installing the package :

To add a progressbar to your next app you will need a package called **Next.js Progressbar**
To install it to your application first open a terminal in your app directory and run

```bash:bash
$ yarn add nextjs-progressbar
or
$ npm i nextjs-progressbar
```

### Basic Usage :

To use this package simply head back to your _\_app.js_ file and import it and add it before the
app component like this

```jsx:/pages/_app.js
import '../styles/globals.css'
import NextNProgress from 'nextjs-progressbar'
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <NextNProgress />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  )
}
export default MyApp
```

### Advanced Usage :

You can overide the default config of _NextNProgress_ you can use some properties like this

```jsx:pages/_app.js
import '../styles/globals.css'
import NextNProgress from 'nextjs-progressbar'
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <NextNProgress
        color="#6B21A8"
        startPosition={0.3}
        stopDelayMs={200}
        height={2}
        showOnShallow={true}
      />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  )
}
export default MyApp
```
